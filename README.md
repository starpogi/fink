My Finance Manager that almost got forgotten. Back in 2009, in Germany, I wanted to track my expenses and make sure I don't go beyond. I made a PHP Web app, but sadly, my Mac book crapped out, and I forgot to save the schema. 

Just putting this here so I can redo this in Python, and maybe have it integrate with Bank APIs, and some receipt OCR.
